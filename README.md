The Product Owner deals with most of user needs by creating user stories. User stories take the form of I want to...[perform some task]so that I can...[achieve some goal]. It is easier to identify what features users want with user stories and what they want to experience. The "perform some task" portion is the feature developers can code. The "achieve some goal" portion is what testers check to see if the experience matches.

While working with a team, I would use an agile approach. I would like to incorporate methods like the Daily Scrum, excellent communication between the team and client,  good estimation techniques, and small iterations that adapt to changes.

A good team member can work independently and maintain transparent communication with the rest of the team. A good team member will interact with others to make sure nothing is unclear. A good team member is also adaptable, able to change whenever a change arises.
